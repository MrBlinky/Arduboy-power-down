Adapted version of CDC.cpp for use in combination with auto power down.

This version does nor reset and disable the WDT whic prevents the 
auto power down feature from working.

Drawbacks:
When the comport is opened for example with Arduino IDE monitor at 1200 baud
the bootloader mode is triggered instandly.
